### Clinical and Public Health Applications

My computational work is grounded in real-world clinical and public health challenges, with a strong focus on last-mile execution and deployment. I also collaborate closely with public health and clinical communities to support research adoption.

### Communities, Papers, and Code

🤝 Moderator / Roundtable organizer for Surveillance and Informatics II, Strengthening Public Health Surveillance: Adapting to Expanding Responsibilities and Data Volume at the National Conference for the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists 

🤝 Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists' (CSTE) Peer-to-Peer Technical Assistance Pod Mentor for the Pennsylvania Dept. of Health and Santa Clara County Public Health Department. On a biweekly cadence, I prepared lectures and hands-on Colab notebooks for concepts relevant to mentees! This was the **longest** running pod!

🎤 Presenter for Surveillance and Informatics II: Identifying Outbreaks from Large Volumes of Public Health Data at the National Conference for the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists 

✍️ [Cases2Beds](https://delphi.cmu.edu/blog/2021/03/10/cases2beds-a-case-study-in-actionable-intelligence/): Project lead for a tool to provision hospital beds, developed in collaboration with the Allegheny County Health Department and shared with several other county public health departments during the COVID-19 Pandemic. Presented on 01/08/2020 at the COVID-19 Trends and Impact Surveys Data Users Meeting. 

✍️ Fulbright Urban Planning & Sustainable Design Award, Singapore, National University of Singapore. IoT and Multimodal data for health. I developed a suite of micro/macro modules (including deep-learning models that use audio, visual, and spatiotemporal input data) designed to work together and assist users in designing urban spaces that are unappealing to mosquitoes.
