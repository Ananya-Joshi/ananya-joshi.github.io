### Generative AI/Monitoring
GenAI applications in healthcare require new approaches for strong alignment, probabilistic guarantees on hallucination, and adaptive guardrails. My prior work in this area includes:

            <p class="card-text">
              I formalized novel machine learning tasks for real-time data monitoring and developed AI methods for monitoring. These methods were deployed in an applied national public health setting where they led to a 200x increase in monitoring efficiency.

             The interface between interpretability tools and successful long-term model monitoring and guardrailing is underexplored. I developed methods and metrics to quantify model steering capacity when model neurons are monosemantic (encode a single concept) that can be monitored for various adversarial attacks.

            Humans are increasingly relying on Generative AI models that can be highly persuasive. These properties are rapidly changing; how do we develop evaluations that keep up?
