    <h3>Ananya A. Joshi</h3>
    <p class="bio-text">
    I'm an Assistant Professor in Psychiatry & Behavioral Science with a secondary appointment in Computer Science at Johns Hopkins University. My group's research develops <b>computational and Generative AI</b> methods and systems for diagnosing, treating, and monitoring <b>mood disorders</b>. I'm also broadly interested in telemedicine systems and patient care.  </p>

<h4 class="mt-5">Current Research Themes</h4>
<ul class="list-unstyled">
	<li><b>• GenAI Guardrailing and Monitoring</b>: Methods and systems with probabilistic guarentees for detecting and monitoring mood disorders. <br> <i>How do we prevent errors when different fields are extracted from clinical notes?</i> </li>
   <li><b>• Drug Matching</b>: Online, high-dimensional statistical matching from noisy and missing data. <br><i>How do we identify which combinations of drug therapies work across highly variable populations?</i></li>
  <li><b>• Experimental Design</b>: Large-scale digital clinical interventions and feedback loops for evaluating GenAI tools in clinical psychiatry. <br> <i>How do we develop a robust learning system with clinicians and researchers?</i> </li>
  
</ul>

<h4 class="mt-4">Opportunities for Students</h4>
<p>
I'm recruiting new and senior students at all levels for different projects. If you're currently a Hopkins student [undergrad, masters, Ph.D] or generally interested in this work [Ph.D.-level], let's chat!
</p>

<h4 class="mt-4">Background</h4>
<p>
I received my Ph.D. and M.S. in Computer Science from Carnegie Mellon University, supported by the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship Program, and my B.S.E. in Computer Science from Princeton University. During my Ph.D., I developed AI methods for data monitoring while simultaneously serving as a project manager to deploy this research in an applied public health setting that's now been used for over 2 years. I've also spent time as a software engineer and researcher in networked and operating systems, protein folding, and general large language model (LLM) alignment — work that has been honored with Rising Stars and Best Paper Awards. Outside of academia, my perspectives toward research and impact have been shaped by my Fulbright year in Singapore, an internship with IBM's Human-Centered AI team in Nairobi, a semester abroad at ETH Zurich, and service that was recognized through a Graduate Student Service Award.
</p>
<p>
Like many, I’ve seen how mood disorders impact the lives of people we love. Being in the School of Medicine, I'll be researching the computational questions that can directly help clinicians and patients  improve outcomes.
