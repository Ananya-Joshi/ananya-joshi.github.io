### Operating Systems 

I continue to draw inspiration from applying computer systems methods to real-world data. Here are some systems projects I’ve worked on:

📄 **[Cooperative Rule Caching for SDN Switches](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9335795/)** Ori Rottenstreich, Ariel Kulik, **Ananya Joshi**, Jennifer Rexford, Gábor Rétvári, Daniel Menasché, 2020 IEEE 9th International Conference on Cloud Networking (CloudNet).  

📄 **[Data Plane Cooperative Caching With Dependencies](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9632694)** Ori Rottenstreich, Ariel Kulik, **Ananya Joshi**, Jennifer Rexford, Gábor Rétvári, Daniel Menasché, 2020 IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management.  

📄 Urban Data Mining in Switzerland, ETH Zurich    

🛠️ [NiChrome](https://github.com/u-root/NiChrome), Google : Intern project with Anthony Rolland, advised by Ron Minnich and Christopher Koch    

🛠️ [COVIDCast Engineering](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2111452118), Delphi: Contributor since 2020.     

I've done other work on Aerogels, Protein Folding and Aggregation, Remote Sensing, and Databases.
